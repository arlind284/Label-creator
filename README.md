Javascript/SVG Label Creator for IC Chips

This project was inspired by Ben Eater's 8-Bit breadboard computer. Multiple errors while building the SAP-1 breadboard computer lead to the desire to label all chips with the actual pinouts.

I used this as an opportunity to learn a bit of SVG and wrote a HTML/Javascript/SVG creator for computer IC chips.
At the moment there is only one monolithic file with a complete set of labels for the Ben Eater's 8-Bit breadboard computer.

I'd be happy to accept pull request for other projects (e.g. Ben Eater's 6502 breadboard computer), additions to the "chip database" and general ideas and improvements.


Big thanks to Ben Eater for the wonderful videos on YouTube. I learned so much from it and finally understood how a cpu works.
